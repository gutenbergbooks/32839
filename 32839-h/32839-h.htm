<p><span class="smcap">A natural</span> anxiety that his pupils should be furnished with as complete a
repertory as possible, has prompted <i>Mr. Punch</i> to command one of his
spare Poets to knock off a little dramatic piece founded (at a
respectful distance) upon a famous Transatlantic model. The spare Poet
in question&mdash;all reluctant as he felt even to appear to be competing
with the inimitable&mdash;had, as the minion of <i>Punch</i> the Peremptory, no
option but to obey to the best of his powers. The special merit of the
present production will be found in the care with which it has been
watered down to suit the capacity of amateurs for whom the original
would offer difficulties well-nigh insuperable. This poem is
particularly recommended to diffident young ladies with a suppressed
talent for recitation. Some on reading it may imagine that its rough but
genuine pathos is scarcely adapted to feminine treatment&mdash;but wait until
you hear some young lady recite it! <i>Mr. Punch</i>, for his part, is
content to wait for almost any length of time. The Author calls it:&mdash;</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Hasdrubal Jopp.</span></center>

<blockquote><i>The Reciter is supposed to be in the Strand, facing the audience. As
you come on, the idea is that you are suddenly attracted by an
advertisement borne by the last of a string of Sandwich-men. You stop
him, and begin as follows. By the way, as you are enacting an American,
you will of course be careful to speak through your nose, whenever it
occurs to you. Now then:&mdash;</i></blockquote>

<h2>DESPATCH WITH ECONOMY.</h2>

<center>(<i>Minutes relative to a Misdirected Telegram, found not a hundred miles
from the G.P.O.</i>)</center><br />

<center><span class="smcap">Original Telegram</span>:&mdash;
<br /><br />
<i>From Lucy to Flutterby, Peacock's Priory, Battersea.</i>
<br /><br />
"Ask <span class="smcap">Jack</span> to dine with us at eight."<br />
</center>

<p><i>First Minute.</i> This Telegram was sent to Peacock's Rest, but there
refused as Mr. <span class="smcap">Flutterby</span> was not there. It was re-directed to what was
supposed to be his address, "Morton's Repository, Whitechapel." It was
again refused. We cannot recover the sixpence. (<i>Official Initials.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Second Minute.</i> Who re-directed the Telegram, and why was it not paid
for before delivery? (<i>Initials as before.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Third Minute.</i> We cannot ascertain the name of the person who
re-directed the Telegram, and did not receive the sixpence because the
Telegram was never accepted. (<i>Initials as before.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Fourth Minute.</i> Who sent the Telegram originally? (<i>Initials as
before.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Fifth Minute.</i> We have sent an Officer to inquire, and find that <span class="smcap">Lucy</span>
lives in Flower Cottage, Kensingbridge&mdash;she is the sender's wife. She
says she knows nothing about the telegram. (<i>Initials as before.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Sixth Minute.</i> Cannot the address of the sender be ascertained?
(<i>Initials as before.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Seventh Minute.</i> We believe the sender must also live in Flower
Cottage, Kensingbridge. Shall we send an Officer to inquire? (<i>Initials
as before.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Eighth Minute.</i> An Officer from the Head Office had better be sent.
(<i>Initials as before.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Ninth Minute.</i> An Officer from the Head Office has been sent. The
sender of the telegram is either out or says he is out. His wife
declares she knows nothing about it. (<i>Initials as before.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Tenth Minute.</i> Has the sender no other address besides Peacock's
Priory, Morton's Repository, and Flower House, Kensingbridge? (<i>Initials
as before.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Eleventh Minute.</i> What is being done about that missing sixpence? A
week since last reply. Its non-payment interferes with the Estimates.
(<i>Initials as before.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Twelfth Minute.</i> Nothing has been done. What can be done? (<i>Initials as
before.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Thirteenth Minute.</i> An Officer should call upon the sender of the
telegram and demand payment of the sixpence. (<i>Initials as before.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Fourteenth Minute.</i> An Officer has called several times, and cannot
find the sender in. His wife repeats she knows nothing about it, and
declines to give information. (<i>Initials as before.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Fifteenth Minute.</i> Has the sender no other address? He must pay the
sixpence. Let him be told this. (<i>Initials as before.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Sixteenth Minute.</i> We have found him at another address, but he still
declines to pay the sixpence, he says he has never received the
telegram. (<i>Initials as before.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Seventeenth Minute.</i> Try again. Let him be informed that if he does not
pay the sixpence, no further telegram of his will be directed.
(<i>Initials as before.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Eighteenth Minute.</i> He has been told so. He says he does not want his
messages re-directed. He has not as yet paid the sixpence. (<i>Initials as
before.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Nineteenth Minute.</i> Ten days since last communication. Has that missing
sixpence been recovered? (<i>Initials as before.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Twentieth Minute.</i> No. The sender of the telegram, we believe, has gone
abroad. (<i>Initials as before.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Twenty-first Minute.</i> Month since receipt of last information. Has that
missing sixpence been recovered? The sender must be asked for it again
if is has not been received. (<i>Initials as before.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Twenty-second Minute.</i> An equivalent to the money due on re-directing
the message has been recovered. The sender has given an Officer of the
Department a French franc. (<i>Initials as before.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Twenty-third Minute.</i> Let the French <i>franc</i> be exchanged for English
money and paid into the account of the Department. Account of expenses
to the Department for collecting the sixpence should now be sent.
(<i>Initials as before.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Final Minute.</i> In compliance with instructions, account of expenses
incurred in collecting the sixpence will be forwarded forthwith. Some
time will be required in setting out the details. Being rather large, it
has been considered advisable to send the packet by Parcels Post.

<p>LORD CHURCHILL, KNOWN AS GRANDOLPH, AT THE BATTLE OF THE
ESTIMATES.</p>
</div>

<hr />

<h2>SEEING HIS WAY.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Times</i> Correspondent at Berlin lately alleged that the cautious and
diplomatic attitude of Prince <span class="smcap">Ferdinand</span> of Coburg had somewhat damped
the enthusiasm of the deputation that waited on him to offer him the
Bulgarian Throne. The following are a few of the "posers" that His
Serene Highness is said to have put to the delegates on the occasion in
question.</p>

<p>What sort of a place is Sofia? Does the climate resemble that of
Hampstead, will it support two Italian Operas in the Season, can it
boast an Underground Railway, and does it contain any respectable agent
for the sale of Turkish cigarettes?</p>

<p>Does the Palace want repapering? Does it contain a throne, regalia, and
other royal appurtenances, left by the late tenant; and, if not, could
the deputation recommend any local emporium where these and other
suitable and necessary things could be temporarily secured at
advantageous terms on the three years' hire system?</p>

<p>Will the Royal Salary touch &pound;300 a year, and will it be paid regularly
in cash, and not in promissory notes at uncertain intervals? Will the
great Sobranje vote an additional sum to the civil list for
boot-cleaning and the expenses of a weekly charwoman for the Royal
household? Will the Prince's cab-hire, on the occasion of his attending
Official banquets, be forthcoming from the same source?</p>

<p>Will the National party raise any objection to the Prince counting five
Russian Generals among the members of his Cabinet, as a slight means of
securing the amiable consideration of the <span class="smcap">Czar</span>?</p>

<p>In the event of a sudden night <i>&eacute;meute</i> threatening the stability of the
throne, would it be the business of the Prime Minister to arouse the
Prince, bring him his boots and shaving-water, and, providing him with a
trick-wig and comic disguise, point out to him briefly in a local
<i>Bradshaw</i> the best available trains starting before dawn for the
frontier?</p>

<p>Finally, if the Prince consented to accept the throne, and hired his
crown and coronation-robes from a well-known costumier's for the
occasion, would the great Sobranje defray the cost, or, if with a view
to the situation being a permanency, he could secure them at the price
of second-hand goods, would they be prepared to come to some arrangement
for their purchase?</p>

made an excellent speech, which was enthusiastically applauded, and Mrs.

<h2>STUDIES FROM MR. PUNCH'S STUDIO.</h2>

<center>No. XXIX.&mdash;<span class="smcap">A Lady Dramatist.</span></center>

<p>"<span class="smcap">You</span> must do it at a <i>Matin&eacute;e</i>," said her little crowd of five o'clock
tea-visitors, "and get Mr. <span class="smcap">Elliston Drury</span> to play the Roman Poet."</p>

<p>One of the company was in earnest. Miss <span class="smcap">Elmira Jenks</span> believed in her
hostess and friend. The others thought it "fun" to "egg on" Miss <span class="smcap">De
Goncourt</span> to make herself ridiculous.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 30%">
<a href="images/041.png">
<img src="images/041.png" width="100%" alt="cartoon" /></a>
</div>

<p>"And why not take the part of the heroine yourself, dear?&mdash;nobody in all
your intellectual set recites so well. Why not act in your own
Tragedy&mdash;how delightful it would be!"</p>

<p>"But you forget," said the Lady Dramatist, pouring out for her friend a
fresh cup of tea from a delicious specimen of Nankin blue into an
equally artistic cup of Oriental white. "You forget that I am thirty."</p>

<p>On the contrary, their memories were excellent.</p>

<p>"Thirty-five, if she's a day," was the silent verdict; aloud, it ran
thus:&mdash;"My dear, a woman is no older than she looks. You are
twenty-five, and, in the classic dress of the Roman Maiden, you will
appear twenty&mdash;not a day older."</p>

<p>"You are very kind," she said; "but flattery is pleasant when it
encourages one's dearest hopes."</p>

<p>"We do not flatter&mdash;we speak as critics, and friends," they replied.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Elliston Drury</span>, the new Tragedian of the Parthenon Theatre, who had
come from the Provinces to astonish London, was the only Actor who had
given Miss <span class="smcap">De Goncourt</span> any real encouragement to persevere in the
direction to which her ambition pointed; but he was full of sympathy,
and knew what it was himself to fight against prejudice, not to say
conspiracy. He had literally hewn his way through the ranks of his
opponents to the position he now held at the Parthenon. It was not a
very high position, it was true, but he had been seen and heard; and the
future was before him.</p>

<p>Similarly, he had argued, in the interests of Dramatic Art, Miss <span class="smcap">De
Goncourt</span> must fight her way. He used the aggressive verb metaphorically,
of course, and in its moral sense; but he meant it to imply all that was
fearless in the conduct of an earnest woman conscious of her literary
and dramatic power&mdash;she must fight her way! It had fallen to his lot to
read many original Dramas, but among all the unacted works of his time,
none were so full of promise as Miss <span class="smcap">De Goncourt's</span> <i>Before the Dawn</i>. He
could wish himself no better fortune than the opportunity of creating
the leading <i>r&ocirc;le</i> at a West End Theatre.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">De Goncourt</span> hung upon the music of his words. At least such was her
confession to Miss <span class="smcap">Elmira Jenks</span>, her admirer and satellite, (every
dramatic student has a human satellite, or a confiding dog, and the
latter is generally the most constant) who agreed with her that in Art,
sympathy is everything.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">De Goncourt</span> may be said to have served an amateur apprenticeship to
the art of the playwright; it had begun at school with Charades; it had
progressed through several seasons of amateur theatricals; it had
culminated in five Acts of blank verse; and apart from the epistolary
appeals that had been made to London Managers, to save the reputation of
native modern dramatists by its immediate production, Miss <span class="smcap">Elmira Jenks</span>
had discussed the work in a certain lady's journal, to which she
contributed, assuring the world that <i>Before the Dawn</i> was worthy of the
noblest efforts of dramatic poetry. Miss <span class="smcap">De Goncourt</span> was also put
forward as an honour to womanhood, having preferred the higher life of
Art to the lower mission of Matrimony; and all that she and her friends
now desired, was a fitting opportunity for the demonstration of the
integrity of her ambition, which was to follow in the footsteps of Mrs.
<span class="smcap">Inchbald</span>, <span class="smcap">Joanna Baillie</span>, and other distinguished lady dramatists. Miss
<span class="smcap">De Goncourt</span> was a spinster and an orphan, with a settled income of three
hundred and fifty pounds a year; and she sat in her little Bedford Park
study from day to day, with a pen in her hand, and a smile on her lips,
a smile of hope and confidence.</p>

<p>It was a dainty room, with a grey dimity dado, that marked off a few old
engravings of poetic and dramatic subjects. The over-mantel was green
and white, with busts of <span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span>, <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>, <span class="smcap">Joan of Arc</span>, and <span class="smcap">Florence
Nightingale</span>, upon its little shelves. There were bookcases and cabinets
here and there, containing favourite authors and relics of great
actresses, such as hair-pins used by <span class="smcap">Helen Faucit</span>, a shoestring
belonging to <span class="smcap">Rachel</span>, and a brooch which had been worn by Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siddons</span>.
Had not these geniuses, watched, waited and suffered? Then what right
had she to be impatient? It must have been a sweet nature that could
philosophise thus in face of an entire cabinet of rejected plays, bound
in white morocco, emblematic of their purity, though destined, it might
be, to revolutionise the present frivolous stage as soon as the
production of <i>Before the Dawn</i> should send both actors and managers to
their author's door ravenous for the right to give her other works to an
astonished and delighted public.</p>

<p>This day of triumph might be nearer than either friends or scoffers
anticipated. Mr. <span class="smcap">Elliston Drury</span> had taken a warm interest in her work;
had indorsed the advice she had received to try <i>Before the Dawn</i> at a
<i>Matin&eacute;e</i>; had consented to play the leading character; and, what was
more interesting still, had volunteered to coach her in the part of the
heroine, if she was willing to impersonate that poetic and
self-sacrificing creation. Miss <span class="smcap">De Goncourt</span> was willing to place herself
in the hands of Mr. <span class="smcap">Elliston Drury</span>; Miss <span class="smcap">De Goncourt</span> did place herself
in his hands; and oh the rapture of hearing her words read to the
assembled company of "Artistes" in the Green Room of the Parthenon
Theatre on the day when the parts were distributed! The delight of those
first rehearsals! She felt so much at home on the Stage, that she began
to dream of a pre-existence in which she had been a priestess of Art,
somewhat after the manner of her Roman girl who, crowned with a poisoned
diadem, was sacrificed in the Temple, but to live again with the gods in
a sublimated world of song. Mr. <span class="smcap">Elliston Drury</span> accompanied her to the
train after each rehearsal, and paid her so much homage, that she began
to associate him in her tender feminine mind with the Roman youth for
whose love she was martyred at the shrine; and, long before the eventful
morning came, Mr. <span class="smcap">Elliston Drury</span> (who had received a fortnight's notice
at the Parthenon, but still had the future all before him) had made up
his mind to hang up his hat, for good, in the &aelig;sthetic little hall of
the <span class="smcap">De Goncourt</span> inside the blue-and-white palings of the Bedford Park
Estate.</p>

<p>"Was it not a success, then, <i>Before the Dawn</i>?" Ask the ring of
authors, the conspirators, the tribe of envy, hatred, and malice
assembled on that memorable occasion to crush the new authoress. Ask the
leading actors, who had always dreaded the day when Mr. <span class="smcap">Elliston Drury</span>
should play a star part in a Metropolitan Theatre. No, Ladies and
Gentlemen, <i>Before the Dawn</i> was a failure. Certain prominent critics
were suborned to say so; and one of them, more cruel than the rest,
declared that all the humorous range of modern Burlesque did not supply
a reminiscence so positively comic as the scene in which the Roman
Maiden, staggering under her poisoned crown (which would fall into an
irresistibly funny angle with the Actress's un-Roman nose), hurled back
upon <span class="smcap">Tiberius C&aelig;sar</span> the curse of the avenging gods.</p>

<p>But they have a consolation, the Lady Dramatist and her illustrious
husband (he did hang up his hat, and his coat, he had little else to
move from his garret in the Strand), in having possibly found a more
useful field of duty than that of an active participation in the work
before the footlights. It has been sarcastically, and we believe
wrongfully asserted by a Tory Earl that critics are men who have failed
as authors; but a similar calumny has been perpetrated by Miss <span class="smcap">Elmira
Jenks</span> (whose satelliteship came to a violent end with the marriage of
her bright particular star to Mr. <span class="smcap">Elliston Drury</span>) who has not hesitated
to declare in her unscrupulous paper that the modern teachers of
elocution are ladies and gentlemen who have failed as actors and
actresses. Mr. and Mrs. <span class="smcap">Elliston Drury</span> nevertheless pursue the even
tenor of their way; their elocution classes are well attended; Mrs.
<span class="smcap">Drury's</span> afternoons never lack interesting visitors; and her husband's
occasional Shakspearian recitals at Hammersmith and Putney, inspire the
local critics with eloquent expressions of regret that the degenerate
condition of the stage should condemn so rare an actor to the
drawing-room and the platform.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Elliston Drury</span> finds this a sufficient balm for his bruised soul;
and his admiring wife declares that walking along the vale of life hand
in hand with <span class="smcap">Elliston</span>, is after all bliss enough, without the added and
questionable joy of being a popular Lady Dramatist.</p>

<p><i>Customer.</i> Humph! I can make shift with that. But this won't do at all.
Tight across the instep and pinches the toes awfully. (<i>Aside.</i>) Hang

(<i>Aloud.</i>) Awfully sorry, I'm sure, m'Lord. We must try again.</p>

<p><i>Customer.</i> You ought to have got the measure of my foot better than
this, especially when I handed you my old lasts.</p>

<p><i>Shoemaker.</i> Well, m'Lord, you see, you've a bit&mdash;ahem!&mdash;<i>outgrown</i> 'em

<p><i>Customer.</i> <i>Outgrown</i> them? What do you mean? Feet don't <i>grow</i> at my

<p><i>Shoemaker (aside).</i> How shall I put it so as not to huff him? Bunions

think&mdash;I&mdash;a&mdash;fancy your last pair&mdash;Gladstone highlows they were&mdash;weren't
they?&mdash;trying shoes for tender feet, m'Lord&mdash;must have been just a
trifle too small, and&mdash;ahem!&mdash;compressed your feet a little, <i>at the
joints</i>, m'Lord.</p>

<p><i>Customer (aside).</i> By Jove, he's right. G.'s tight fits have galled me
for some time past, and the last pair he made me I simply couldn't get
on. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Hang it, man, what has that to do with it? Your business
is to fit my feet as they are. If you can't do it&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Shoemaker (hastily).</i> <i>Can't</i>, m'Lord? No such word in our shop,
m'Lord. I flatter myself we could fit the biggest beetle-crusher ever
bunion'd into the shape of a giant potato or a Californian nugget. Much
more <i>your</i> shapely foot, m'Lord, which, if it has been nubblyfied a
leetle by misfits, will soon recover its proper proportions&mdash;under
proper treatment.</p>

<p><i>Customer.</i> Well, off with this boot, anyhow. You'll have to make it
longer and wider, ease it here and slacken it there, before <i>I</i> can wear
it.</p>

<p><i>Shoemaker.</i> Very good, m'Lord. (<i>Aside.</i>) Doosed imperative, but I
can't afford to offend him. Though I never expected an old-established
high-class firm like ours would have stooped to tout for any of botching
G.'s old customers. There's Mr. <span class="smcap">Joseph Brummagem</span>, now, fancy my having
to kneel at <i>his</i> feet, and take <i>his</i> measure! More particular than
this one, if anything, and puts him up to half his objections, I
believe. Well, well, trade's bad, and we mustn't be too scrupulous, I
suppose. Besides, some of G.'s old customers seem drifting back to the
old shop we thought was just about shutting up, and that won't do at any
price.</p>

<p><i>Customer (irritably).</i> What are you muttering and murmuring about?</p>

<p><i>Shoemaker.</i> Murmuring, m'Lord? Oh dear no, m'Lord. Not at all, m'Lord.
Quite <i>the</i> contrary. I was only blessing that there G. for spoiling the
Trade as he has done. Brought us down from Wellingtons, and even his own
smartly cut Oxonians to borough Bluchers and rustic highlows; and now
wants to set a new fashion all on a sudden, and make us all take to his
confounded badly cut Irish brogues. Yah! Chaps like G. ought to be
boycotted&mdash;ahem!&mdash;I mean Primrose-Leagued out of the profession. Wonder
any gentleman can condescend to deal with him. Now, <i>my</i> customers, as
your friend Mr. <span class="smcap">Joseph</span> kindly acknowledged t'other day, are gentlemen to
a man, and for cut, style, finish and polish, I <i>will</i> say&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Customer.</i> Oh, yes, no doubt. But the point just at present, my good
fellow, is <i>fit</i>. If you miss that you miss all.</p>

<p><i>Shoemaker (eagerly).</i> Oh, have no fear on that account, m'Lord.
Elastic's the word, m'Lord. We've any number of different trees, and our

<p><i>Shoemaker (with effusion).</i> Oh, we'll alter it to <i>any</i> extent, to suit
your taste, m'Lord, though it isn't exactly the cut upon which our House

eased it you'll be able to wear it with perfect comfort. We can't afford
to lose <i>your</i> custom, m'Lord!</p>

<p class="i6">'Ow are yer, my arty, and 'ow does this Summer suit <i>you?</i></p>
<p class="i0">Selp me never, old pal, it's a scorcher! <i>I</i> lap lemon-squosh till all's blue,</p>
<p class="i0">And then feel as dry as a dust-bin. Want all <span class="smcap">Spiers</span> and <span class="smcap">Pond's</span> upon trust,</p>
<p class="i0">For it do make a 'ole in the ochre to deal with a true first-class thust.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">But it's proper, dear boy, yus it's proper, this weather is, took on the 'ole,</p>
<p class="i0">And for 'oliday outings and skylarks it sets a chap fair on the roll.</p>
<p class="i0">Where d'yer think as I spent my last bust up? I know you'd be out of the 'unt</p>
<p class="i0">If you guessed for a 'ole month o' Sundays. I passed it, old pal, <i>in a punt!</i></p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"O Walker!" sez you, "that's 'is gammon!" No, <span class="smcap">Charlie</span>, it's righteous, dear boy.</p>
<p class="i0">It's quite true that to chivvy Thames hanglers is jest what we used to enjoy.</p>
<p class="i0">Rekerlek that old buffer at Richmond, and 'ow we shoved foul of his swim,</p>
<p class="i0">And lost him a middlin'-sized barbel and set his straw tile on the skim?</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Hangling isn't my mark, that's a moral, and fishermen mostly is fools;</p>
<p class="i0">To chaff 'em and tip 'em the kibosh is one of my reglarest rules;</p>
<p class="i0">And it ain't our sort only as does it, you take the non-anglers all round,</p>
<p class="i0">An you'll find that in potting the puntist they're <span class="smcap">'Arries</span> right down to the ground.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">All our chicest stock-jokes and pet patter they mops up, like mugs as they are,</p>
<p class="i0">For they <i>might</i> cut their own chaff, eh, <span class="smcap">Charlie</span>? not borrow it all from the bar.</p>
<p class="i0">But I've seen little toffs in white weskits a slinging <i>our</i> lingo to rights,</p>
<p class="i0">About colds, and cock-salmons, and shop 'uns; it's one of the rummiest sights.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Of course they all trot out <span class="smcap">Sam Johnson</span>; you know the fine crusted old wheeze.</p>
<p class="i0">I chucked it one day at a cove as lay stretched at the foot of some trees.</p>

<p class="i0">'Owsomever <i>I</i>'ve 'ad a day's 'ooking at last, and it wasn't arf bad.</p>
<p class="i0">You know since I turned Primrose Leaguer I've mixed with the Toppers, my lad;</p>
<p class="i0">And one on 'em, pal of the Prince, I believe, got <span class="smcap">Jack Jolter</span> a pass</p>
<p class="i0">For some fine preserved waters; no pay, mate, and everythink fixed up fust-class.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0"><span class="smcap">Jack</span> arsked me and <span class="smcap">Bell Bonsor</span> to jine him, and seein' it didn't mean tin,</p>
<p class="i0">And the 'ole thing seemed swell, with good grubbing and lots o' prime lotion chucked in.</p>
<p class="i0">I was "on" like a shot. <span class="smcap">Bell's</span> a bloomer, and <span class="smcap">Jack</span>, though a bit of a jug,</p>
<p class="i0">Is too long in the purse to let slip; so the game looked all proper and snug.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0"><span class="smcap">Jack's</span> a straw-thatched young joker in gig-lamps, good-natured, and nuts on the sport.</p>
<p class="i0">He turns up with four rods and two bait-cans, and tackle of every dashed sort.</p>
<p class="i0">Such rum-looking gimcracks, my pippin; lines coiled up in boxes and books,</p>
<p class="i0">And live-bait, and worms all a-wriggle, and big ugly bunches of 'ooks.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0"><i>I</i> was a'most afraid to set down, for the things seemed all over the shop,</p>
<p class="i0">And <span class="smcap">Bell</span> she kep startin' and squeakin', a-settin' me fair on the 'op;</p>
<p class="i0">Fust a fish as dabbed flop on her 'at, then a 'ook as got snagged in 'er skirt,</p>
<p class="i0">It was one blessed squork all the time, mate, though nothink much 'appened to 'urt.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Pooty spot; sort o' lake green and windin', with nice quiet "swims" all about.</p>
<p class="i0">Though I must say <i>I</i> missed the Thames gammocks, the snide comic song, and the shout.</p>
<p class="i0">No larks at the locks, no collisions, no landings for lotion, you know,</p>
<p class="i0">And, but for Miss <span class="smcap">Bell</span> and the bottle, it might a bin jest a bit slow.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">But the prog was A 1, and no kid. Though <span class="smcap">Jack</span> stuck to his tackle like wax,</p>
<p class="i0"><span class="smcap">Bell</span> and me was soon stodging like winkles; that gal <i>did</i> make play with the snacks.</p>
<p class="i0">"<i>Strike!</i>" cries <span class="smcap">Jack</span>&mdash;"you've a <i>bite</i>!" "Yes, I know it," sez I, with my mouth full of 'am.</p>
<p class="i0">"Wot do <i>you</i> think, Miss B.?"&mdash;and she larfed till 'er cheeks went like raspberry jam.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0"><span class="smcap">Jolter</span> looked jest a mossel disgusted, and turned a bit rusty, for <i>him</i>,</p>
<p class="i0">When we made the punt rock in our romps, which he said was "disturbing the swim."</p>
<p class="i0">And when he had hooked a fine perch, and Miss <span class="smcap">Bell</span> made a dash at the line,</p>
<p class="i0">And the fish flobbered back with a flop, <span class="smcap">Jack's</span> escape from a cuss cut it fine.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Then he pulled in his "trimmer," and, scissors! a jolly big jack came aboard,</p>
<p class="i0">Wich flopped round us, and showed his sharp teeth, till Miss <span class="smcap">Bonsor</span> went pasty, and roared.</p>
<p class="i0">Reg'lar shark; made a grab at my pants when I tried to cut in to <span class="smcap">Bell's</span> aid;</p>
<p class="i0">And I'm blowed if she didn't turn raspy, and chaff me for being <i>afraid</i>.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Arter this things appeared to go quisby; <span class="smcap">Bell's</span> skirt 'ad got slimed, dontcher see.</p>
<p class="i0">And she vowed it was spiled, while <span class="smcap">Jack</span> looked jest as though he could scrumplicate me.</p>
<p class="i0">So sez I, "Let us turn up this barney, and toddle ashore for some grub;"</p>
<p class="i0">And we pulled up the stone and the hanchor, and made a bee-line for our pub.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">The dinner soon smoothed down our feathers, though <span class="smcap">Jack</span> 'ad a sad sort o' look.</p>

<p class="i0">Bless yer 'art, 'cos we struck arter dinner, and chucked up the perch for a spree,</p>
<p class="i0">And took a turn round, me a pulling, that <span class="smcap">Jack</span> looked as blue as could be.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">'Owsomever we chaffed 'im a good 'un. Miss <span class="smcap">Bell</span> and yours truly got thick,</p>

<h2>THE COUNTRY-COUSIN'S VADE MECUM.</h2>

<p><i>Question.</i> So you have conscientiously done the Jubilee?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> Certainly. For the last month I have scarcely ever been to
bed.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Why?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Somehow I have not retired to rest before it has been
time to get up.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Did you go to the Abbey?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> That I did! Most touching! Shall never forget&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Thank you. I think I can supply as much as you want of that sort of
thing. I will not trouble you for any descriptions. Were you at the
Guildhall Ball?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> I was, and saw all the foreign Royalties.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> How did the <span class="smcap">Lord Mayor</span> get through it?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> On the whole, well; although the Remembrancer, in a full-bottomed
wig, rushing about, in a very energetic fashion, was suggestive of
<i>Fusbos</i> in <i>Bombastes Furioso</i>.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Were you at the Royal Academy <i>Soir&eacute;e</i>?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Certainly. It was a very large gathering.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> And who did you see there?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> The same persons as those I had noticed in the Abbey.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> And they were&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>A.</i> The persons I had seen at the Reform Club
Ball.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> And they?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Were subsequently found at the Inner Temple Ball,
the Gray's Inn Maske, and the laying of the foundation-stone of the
Institute.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Was the <i>Maske of Flowers</i> a success?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> A very great success;
but it was all I could do to keep awake&mdash;I was so dead beat&mdash;in the
Gray's Inn grounds at the Garden Party afterwards.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> And the Volunteer Review&mdash;how did you like that?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Oh, splendid! Nearly thirty thousand men all marching past.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> And the Review at Aldershot?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Magnificent! Nearly seventy thousand men marching past.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Did they all pass you?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Yes, all. They took three hours or more in doing it. They were all
alike. Seventy thousand men, all alike, for three hours. It was deeply
interesting.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Did you see the <span class="smcap">Queen</span>?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> I saw where she was, but <span class="smcap">Her Majesty</span> was concealed from view by the
Long Valley dust.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Did you go to the Lincoln's Inn Garden Party?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> To meet Lord <span class="smcap">Herschell</span>, his friends, and the Prince and Princess?
Certainly. It differed from other Garden Parties in having in the
grounds a sort of bath containing a fountain, ducks, and (to the best of
my belief) turtles.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Have you been to many Garden Parties?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Oh yes, to a large number. I have been to nineteen with Indian
Princes complete, and two without.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Did you go to the Naval Review?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Oh yes; in the middle of the night. I came back before the dawn on
the following morning.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Was it very beautiful?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Very&mdash;what I could see of it.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What did you see of it?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Not much.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Have you done anything else?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> I have been in a chronic state of dinners, balls, operas, laying of
foundation-stones, fireworks, and marches past.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Are you at all confused?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> So much confused, that I have just head enough left to try, in a
feeble manner, to get back to the country.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> And if you do get back to the country, when shall you again visit
town?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Well, it is my impression, not just immediately!</p>

<h2>SIDONIAN SHAKSPEARE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a deep and dark recess, among the sepulchral chambers of Sidon, on a
splendid Sarcophagus in black stone, the delvers of the Palestine
Exploration Committee lately discovered an ancient Ph&oelig;nician
inscription, which has been translated in a Beyrout newspaper as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"I, <span class="smcap">Talnite</span>, Priest of Astarte, and King of Sidon, son of
<span class="smcap">Eshmunazar</span>, Priest of Astarte, and King of Sidon, lying in this
tomb, say:&mdash;Come not to open my tomb; there is here neither gold,
nor silver, nor treasure. He who will open this tomb shall have no
prosperity under the sun, and shall not find repose in the grave."</p></blockquote>

<p>If the explorers who unearthed <span class="smcap">Talnite's</span> epitaph had been able to read
it, they might have been fit to shake in their shoes; only that no
Arch&aelig;ologist now makes any bones whatever of rifling an ancient tomb.
Hereafter, perhaps, the Australian emissary of a British Exploration
Fund will not be deterred by a commination similar to the foregoing from
opening the tomb of <span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span>, and perhaps removing both that
Sarcophagus and its contents, should he find any remaining, to a
Melbourne Museum.</p>

<h4>GIVING IT THEM ALL ROUND.</h4>
</div>

<p><i>Monday, July 18.</i>&mdash;Pretty incident in Lords to-night. Debate on Third
Reading of Coercion Bill. In middle of proceedings <span class="smcap">Denman</span> remembered
four other lines for quotation from late Lord <span class="smcap">Houghton's</span> poems. Last
time he recited from this source the reporters, as he complained, had
not reproduced the quotation. Evidently in strong force in Gallery
to-night; working away at high pressure. Now the time, or never. So
<span class="smcap">Denman</span> rose and began&mdash;</p>

<p>
"My name is <span class="smcap">Norval</span>&mdash;&mdash;"<br />
</p>

<p>Unfortunately <span class="smcap">Granville</span> rose at same moment. Didn't seem at all
interested in further biographical details, and recurred to Coercion
Bill. <span class="smcap">Denman</span> not to be turned aside.</p>

<p>
"&mdash;&mdash;On the Grampian hills,"<br />
</p>

<p>he continued; whereupon the Markiss rose and moved formal Resolution
that <span class="smcap">Granville</span> be heard.</p>

<p>Evidently some misunderstanding; but <span class="smcap">Denman</span> too polite to insist on
pushing himself forward; resumed his seat, and patiently awaited
conclusion of <span class="smcap">Granville's</span> speech. Thereupon promptly rose again, and
approached the table. So did the Markiss, and the two Statesmen stood
and glared at each other across the table.</p>

<p>"My name&mdash;&mdash;" <span class="smcap">Denman</span> began.</p>

<p>"My Lords," said the Markiss.</p>

<p>"Order! order!" shouted the Peers. Then <span class="smcap">Granville</span> remembered what the
Markiss had done for him in similar circumstances, and, interposing,
moved that the Markiss be heard. House agreed, and <i>Norval</i>, retiring
from the Grampian hills, withdrew to the Lowlands by the Bar.</p>

<p>In Commons <span class="smcap">Grandolph</span> turned up in his favourite character as Economist.
Crammed to the moustache. Figures which he rattled out show that First
Lord and Board of Admiralty are spendthrifts. Quite a marvellous store
of learning, which hampered <span class="smcap">Hamilton</span>, baffled <span class="smcap">Beresford</span>, riled <span class="smcap">Reed</span> and
flurried <span class="smcap">Forwood</span>.</p>

<p>This, the serious business of the sitting, prefaced by a privilege case
which of course attracted much more attention. <span class="smcap">Long</span> complained that on
addressing <span class="smcap">Tanner</span> in Lobby after debate of Friday, Member for Mid-Cork
had turned upon him and abused him in coarsest language. Old Morality
moved that <span class="smcap">Tanner</span> be suspended for a month. Many Members of opinion that
O. M. need not have been so precise. As they <i>were</i> hanging him up, a
month or two more or less would make no difference. Others laid the
blame on <span class="smcap">Long</span>, who opened the conversation.</p>

<p>"If a man touches pitch he must expect to be defiled," said Lady <span class="smcap">Parker</span>,
gyrating coquettishly in the Lobby. <span class="smcap">Sexton</span> moved ad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>journment of debate
till Thursday. In course of speech fell upon <span class="smcap">Gent-Davis</span> standing at Bar,
"smiling," as <span class="smcap">Sexton</span> bitterly said, "in such a superior manner." Finding
a head there, <span class="smcap">Sexton</span> brought down shillelagh on it. Suddenness of
assault took away G.-D.'s breath. Very indignant when he recovered.</p>

<p>"What business had he to attack me?" he asked. "I'll interpolate the
<span class="smcap">Speaker</span>, and see if this, too, isn't a Breach of Privilege."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Supply.</p>

<h4>"If a man touches pitch," &amp;c.</h4>
</div>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Seems <span class="smcap">Tanner</span> not the only Member who has been "saying
things" in the Lobby. Alderman <span class="smcap">Fowler</span> accused of having sinned in a
similar way against <span class="smcap">Howell</span>. Irish Members gleefully taken up case.
<span class="smcap">Sexton</span> gave notice that on Thursday, when Motion for suspension of
<span class="smcap">Tanner</span> comes on, he will move that <span class="smcap">Fowler</span> be also suspended for a month.
"They can go away together for a month in the country," <span class="smcap">Tim Healy</span> says;
"or might take a trip to Norway. Anyhow, they'll be able to pair for the
remainder of the Session."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fowler</span> makes light of the threat, but not at all a pleasant thing.
Parliamentary life, as a whole, getting rather a weariness to the flesh.
Only the other day he was sat upon in connection with the manufacture of
bogus petitions, now is to be brought up for using bad language in the
Lobby. Wishes he'd been made a Jubilee Peer.</p>

<p>After questions, gallant little Wales came up, piping its eye.
Thirty-one men been arrested in connection with Tithe Riots near Ruthin.
Government, having got into swing in Ireland, proposed to change the
<i>venue</i>, and try prisoners by Special Jury. <span class="smcap">Ellis</span> moved Adjournment in
order to protest. Backed up by <span class="smcap">Osborne Morgan</span>, <span class="smcap">Harcourt</span>, <span class="smcap">Dillwyn</span>, and
others. On other side, <span class="smcap">Attorney-General</span> justified course taken, and
<span class="smcap">Solicitor-General</span> declared <span class="smcap">Osborne Morgan's</span> speech "a scandal to the
House of Commons." Idea of <span class="smcap">Osborne Morgan</span> creating a scandal shocked the
House; <span class="smcap">Clarke</span> obliged to withdraw remark, and apologise.</p>

<p>Gem of the evening was <span class="smcap">Swetenham's</span> speech. Delightful the ease and
fluency with which he pronounced such words as Llanymrech and
Llansaintfraid, and others guiltless of a vowel. Delicious the way in
which he ogled <span class="smcap">Osborne Morgan</span>, slily insinuating his intimate knowledge
of the criminal classes. What with his remarks, and the accusation of
the <span class="smcap">Solicitor-General</span>, House began to think there was more in <span class="smcap">Osborne
Morgan</span> than met the eye, and that it had, unawares, been nursing a viper
in its bosom.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Supply.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Dr. <span class="smcap">Tanner</span> and Alderman <span class="smcap">Fowler</span> both in their places at
Question Time. First business on paper was Adjourned Debate on Old
Morality's Motion to suspend <span class="smcap">Tanner</span> for a month. <span class="smcap">Sexton</span> gave notice to
haul up the Alderman on charge similar to that which hung over meek head
of <span class="smcap">Tanner</span>. <span class="smcap">Tanner</span> in apologetic mood, but the Alderman defiant. In
course of debate <span class="smcap">Howell</span>, alleged victim of Alderman's minatory
observations, attempted to introduce the subject. <span class="smcap">Tanner</span> debate been on
for hour and half; began to flag a little. Time seemed opportune for
serving up the Alderman. But <span class="smcap">Speaker</span> peremptorily interposed, and would
have none of it. Sufficient for the day was the <span class="smcap">Tanner</span> thereof, and so
the Alderman, a pillar of the Church, a mainstay of the State, must go
down to posterity under charge of having used naughty words in the
Lobby.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tanner</span> episode proved lively enough. <span class="smcap">Tanner</span> apologised for language used
to <span class="smcap">Walter Long</span>, and duly expressed his regret. All eyes turned upon Old
Morality. Expected, as Leader of House, to interpose, and bring
unsavoury proceedings to swift close&mdash;and so, let us go to business. But
O. M. let <span class="smcap">Long</span> slip in with correction of <span class="smcap">Tanner's</span> version of what had
passed. Squabbled for half-an-hour as to what had really been said.
House got its back up. Opportunity for controlling it passed. Storm grew
higher as moments slipped by. <span class="smcap">Harcourt</span> in his element, thumping the
table and shouting at top of his voice in effort, sometimes vain, to
make himself heard amid clamour on opposite benches. Finally, <span class="smcap">Whitbread</span>
appealed to <span class="smcap">Speaker</span> to give his opinion. This awkward for <span class="smcap">Speaker</span>, who
must needs offend one or other of angry parties. Acquitted himself
admirably. With infinite tact expressed his opinion that, as contended
from Opposition Benches, <span class="smcap">Tanner's</span> apology "formal, distinct, and
unreserved." Rather a snub this for Old Morality and <span class="smcap">Hartington</span>, who had
backed him up. But decision unanimously accepted, and the smile which
<span class="smcap">Bigwood</span> reported he had "seen on the countenance of Dr. <span class="smcap">Tanner</span>" when
first addressed in Lobby by <span class="smcap">Long</span>, returned.</p>

<p>"We've lost two hours' precious time," said <span class="smcap">Kennaway</span>, walking out, "and
the only person that's made anything out of it is <span class="smcap">Tanner</span>. A week ago was
in low water, snubbed by his own friends, for whom his conduct was too
bad. Now elevated to position of persecuted hero, made the subject of
elaborate debate, dragged Government into fresh muddle, and brought upon
them rebuke from highest authority in the House."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Got into Committee on Land Bill.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;House assembled this afternoon at Waterloo Station, bound for
Portsmouth and Southampton, to see the Review.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Took return-tickets.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear</span> me!" said Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ram</span>, "I always thought that Margarine was a foreign
title. Wasn't there a Margarine of Hesse?"</p><br />
